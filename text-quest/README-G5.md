# Goal 5: Working with lists

We have worked a lot with arrays, and using `for` loops to _iterate_ over array elements. Arrays are
great when you the number of items you want to store in the array does not change, because the
**length** of an array **can not be changed** once you create it. What to do, then, if you need to
deal with a changing number of items?

## First idea: create new arrays

What if you just create a new array when the number of items you need to store in it changes? Why
not, that is not a bad idea. Imagine you start with an array `src` of length `len1`, but need an
array of length `len2`. You could create a **new** array `dest` of length `len2`, and then **copy**
the needed elements of `src` into `dest`. Java even provides a specialized method to copy the
elements of one array into another:

```java
System.arraycopy(src, srcPosition, dest, destPosition, count)
```

You just have to tell it the starting position to start copying from, and the destination position
to start copying to, and the number of elements you want to copy.

### Example 1: grow an array

Let us take an example where we want to "grow" an array of 5 elements into an array of 6 elements,
so we can add a new 6th element to the **end** of the new array. Here is an example of what that
looks like:

```java
// our 5-element starting array
int[] src = new int[] {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

// a new element we want to set as the 6th element of the new array
int elementToAdd = 6;

// our 6-element destination array
int[] dest = new int[6];

// copy all 5 src elements into dest, such that
// src[0] -> dest[0]
// ...
// src[4] -> dest[4]
System.arraycopy(src, 0, dest, 0, src.length);

// set our new 6th element
dest[5] = elementToAdd;
```

At this point, `dest` has 6 elements and looks like `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`. Splendid!
In our prgram we can then start using `dest` in place of `src`.

### Example 2: shrink an array

Now for an example where we want to "shrink" an array of 5 elements into an array of 4
elements, discarding the 5th (last) element. Here is an example of what that looks like:

```java
// our 5-element starting array
int[] src = new int[] {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

// our 4-element destination array
int[] dest = new int[4];

// copy the first 4 elements of src elements into dest, such that
// src[0] -> dest[0]
// src[1] -> dest[1]
// src[2] -> dest[2]
// src[3] -> dest[3]
System.arraycopy(src, 0, dest, 0, dest.length);
```

At this point, `dest` has 4 elements and looks like `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. Wonderful!

> :question: Why in this example is the last argument passed to `System.arraycopy()`
> set to `dest.length`, while in the previous example it was set to `src.length`?

## Second idea: linked list

What if we wanted to have a list of **ten zillion** items, but for whatever reason it was not
possible to have an array of **ten zillion** length. How could we manage this? One solution is what
is known as a **linked list**. A linked list is a classic computing data structure, where we wrap
each item in a **container element** that includes a reference, or **link**, to the **next** element
in the list. For example, visualize a linked lists of strings like this:

```
+---------------+     +----------------+     +----------------+
| Element       |     | Element        |     | Element        |
+---------------+     +----------------+     +----------------+
| Item: "apple" |     | Item: "banana" |     | Item: "cherry" |
| Next:  ------------>| Next: -------------->| Next:          |
+---------------+     +----------------+     +----------------+
```

Notice how the last elements's `Next` links to **nothing**: that signals the end of the list. These
squares in the diagram are the **list elements** and you can think of these very much like little
boxes that hold the actual item you want along with the directions to the next box. In Java a linked
list element class might look like this:

```java
/**
 * An element in a linked list.
 * 
 * @param <T> the item type
 */
public static class LinkedListElement<T> {

    private final T item;              // the element value
    private LinkedListElement<T> next; // the next element

    /**
     * Constructor.
     * 
     * @param item the item
     */
    public LinkedListElement(T item) {
        super();
        this.item = item;
    }

    /**
     * Get the item.
     * 
     * @return
     */
    public T item() {
        return item;
    }

    /**
     * Get the next element in the list.
     * 
     * @return the next element in the list
     */
    public LinkedListElement<T> next() {
        return next;
    }
}
```

The funky `<T>` part is called a **generic type** or just **generic**. It is a placeholder for some
actual type. For example imagine you would like a linked list of integers. In that case, you could
create a list element of type `Integer` like this:

```java
var element = new LinkedListElement<Integer>(123);
// element.item() returns 123
```

You could also have a linked list of strings, and then the list element of type `String` would look
like this:

```java
var element = new LinkedListElement<String>("foobar");
// element.item() returns "foobar"
```

#### Linked list class

Now that we have defined our linked list **element** class in `LinkedListElement<T>`, we can define
an actual linked list class. The class structure is actually pretty simple: the only thing a linked
list class needs to "know" is what the starting, or **head** element of the list is. Once you have
the head of the list, that means you could use the **next** link on each element to make your way to
any other element in the list. You can visualize the list like this:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| Linked List                                                     |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| Head: --+                                                       |
|         |                                                       |
|         v                                                       |
| +---------------+     +----------------+     +----------------+ |
| | Element       |     | Element        |     | Element        | |
| +---------------+     +----------------+     +----------------+ |
| | Item: "apple" |     | Item: "banana" |     | Item: "cherry" | |
| | Next:  ------------>| Next: -------------->| Next:          | |
| +---------------+     +----------------+     +----------------+ |
|                                                                 |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Here the `Head` property points to the first element in the list.

> :question: If the list was empty, what does `Head` point to?

In Java a linked list class might look like this (using the `LinkedListElement<T>` class
for elements):

```java
public class LinkedList<T> {

    // the head element, or start, of the list
    private LinkedListElement<T> head;

}
```

Here the `LinkedList<T>` class defines a `head` property of type `LinkedListElement<T>`, where
`head` represents the first element in the list.

> :bulb: Remember that the `<T>` syntax is used as a placeholder for the **type of item** stored in
> the list... like `String` or `Integer`. In your head, whenever you see `T` you might replace that

> themselves are of no real consequence.

### Iterate over a linked list

You are familiar with looping over the elements of an array, often with a `for` loop like:

```java
var array = new int[] {1, 2, 3};
for (   int i = 0;         // start at first element
        i < array.length;  // stop after last element
        i = i + 1) {       // move to next element
    System.out.println("Item %d is: %d".formatted(i, array[i]));
}
```

Looping over an array, or a list, is also called **iterating** or **iteration**. Instead of saying
"loop over the array" you can say **iterate over the array**. So how can you iterate over a linked
list, that does support the array-style index operator `[i]`? We use the `Next` links, starting with
the **first element** of the list, also know as the **head** of the list. Something like this:

```java
var list = new LinkedList<Integer>(1, 2, 3);
int i = 0;
for (    var element = list.head();     // start at first element (head)
         element != null;               // stop after last element
         element = element.next()) {    // move to next element
    System.out.println("Item %d is: %d".formatted(i, element.item());
    i++;
}
```

Compare this `for` loop closely with that of the earlier array loop. The first think you might
notice is that our `i` count variable is not part of the `for` statement at all: it is initialized
before the loop and then incremented within the loop. That is because the `for` statement is looping
over the elements of the list, starting at `list.head()` and stopping when `element.next()` is
`null`.

### Example 1: grow a linked list

If we want to add an item to the end of a linked list, you must **find the last** element
and set its `Next` link to the new element. The list changes to this:

```
+--------+     +--------+     +--------+     +--------+
| Item 1 |     | Item 2 |     | Item 3 |     | Item 4 |
| Next ------->| Next ------->| Next ------->| Next   |
+--------+     +--------+     +--------+     +--------+
```

### Example 2: shrink a linked list

If we want to remove an item from the end of a linked list, you must **find the next-to-last** element
and clear its `Next` link. The list changes to this:

```
+--------+     +--------+     +--------+
| Item 1 |     | Item 2 |     | Item 3 |
| Next ------->| Next   |     | Next   |
+--------+     +--------+     +--------+
```

Notice how **Item 3** is disconnected from the list now: we have effectively removed it!

> :question: How could you remove the last 2 items from the list?

### Example 3: insert in the middle

If we want to insert an item into the middle of the list, for example **between items 2 and 3**,
we need to manipulate a couple of `Next` links. Imagine we start with this:

```
+--------+     +--------+     +--------+
| Item 1 |     | Item 2 |     | Item 3 |
| Next ------->| Next ------->| Next   |
+--------+     +--------+  ↑  +--------+
                       +--------+
                       | Item 4 |
                       | Next   |
                       +--------+
```

> :question: Can you see what needs to happen here?

We need to:

 1. Find Item 2
 2. Move Item 2's `Next` to point to Item 4
 3. Set Item 4's `Next` to point to Item 3

 It looks a bit like this:

```
+--------+     +--------+               +--------+
| Item 1 |     | Item 2 |               | Item 3 |
| Next ------->| Next + |            +->| Next   |
+--------+     +------|-+            |  +--------+
                      |   +--------+ |
                      |   | Item 4 | |
                      +-->| Next ----+
                          +--------+
```

We can re-phrase that process to make it more general, given a `NewItem` item we want to insert into the list:

1. Find `PrevItem`, the item we want to insert the new item **after**
2. Set `NewItem.Next` to `PrevItem.Next`
3. Set `PrevItem.Next` to `NewItem`

> :question: This process sets `NewItem.Next` before `PrevItem.Next`. Could it do this the other way around?
> Why or why not?

In Java this process might look like this:

```java
LinkedListElement<String> newItem = new LinkedListItem("Item 4");
LinkedListElement<String> prevItem = findItem(2);
newItem.next = prevItem.next;
prevItem.next = newItem;
```

## Exercise: linked list


The [`LinkedLists`](./src/test/java/coding101/tq/example/LinkedLists.java) class is a
partially implemented program that allows you to create and manipulate a linked list.
You can add words to the list by typing `a <word>` or remove a word with `r <word>`.
You can reverse the list by typing `b`.

What you need to implement are a series of `TODO` comments in the `LinkedList` class.

```java
public static class LinkedList<T> {

    // the head element, or start, of the list
    private LinkedListElement<T> head;

}
```

Note the `head` field which is a `LinkedListElement<T>` object, the same class as discussed earlier.

Here is an example run of the `LinkedLists` program:

```
Word list has 0 items: []

Type 'a <word>' or 'r <word>' to add/remove words.
Type 'I <word1> <word2>' to insert <word1> before <word2>.
Type 'i <word1> <word2>' to insert <word1> after <word2>.
Type 'b' or 'c' to reverse/clear the list.
Command: a a
Item [a] added.

Word list has 1 items: [
    1. a
]

Command: a b
Item [b] added.

Word list has 2 items: [
    1. a
    2. b
]

Command: b
The list is reversed.

Word list has 2 items: [
    1. b
    2. a
]

Command: i c b
Item [c] inserted after [b].

Word list has 3 items: [
    1. b
    2. c
    3. a
]

Command: I d a
Item [d] inserted before [a].

Word list has 4 items: [
    1. b
    2. c
    3. d
    4. a
]

Command: r b
Item [b] removed.

Word list has 3 items: [
    1. c
    2. d
    3. a
]
```

### Linked list unit tests

You can also verify your code by running the
[`LinkedListTests`](./src/test/java/coding101/tq/example/LinkedListTests.java) **unit tests**. Unit
tests are code that run and verify other code, and are used by programmers to validate their code
works as expected.

You can execute the tests easily in VS Code, by clicking the green arrows that appear in the
`LinkedListTests` class, or right-click to execute the tests in the debugger:

<img alt="VS Code unit test class" src="./docs/linked-list-unit-test@2x.png" width="986">

The success or failure of each test method will then appear:

<img alt="VS Code unit test outcome" src="./docs/linked-list-unit-test-outcome@2x.png" width="1087">

> :fire: To succeed fully on this exercise, all `LinkedListTests` tests must **pass** (run
> successfully).

### Task 1: add to end of list

Implement the `add(item)` method, which should add `item` to the **end** of the list:

```java
/**
 * Add an item to the end of the list.
 * 
 * @param item the item to add
 */
public void add(T item) {
    // TODO: add item to the end of the list
}
```

### Task 2: iterate over list

```java
/**
 * Iterate over all items in the list, invoking a callback function for each
 * item.
 * 
 * @param fn the callback function to call for every item in the list
 */
public void forEach(Consumer<T> fn) {
    // TODO: iterate over all items in the list and invoke fn.accept() on each
}
```

### Task 3: count number of items in the list

Implement the `size()` method, which should return the number of items in the list.

```java
/**
 * Get the number of elements in the list.
 * 
 * @return the count of elements in the list
 */
public int size() {
    int size = 0;

    // TODO: count and return the number of elements in the list

    return size;
}
```

### Task 4: insert after an existing item

Implement `insertAfter(item, after)`, which should insert `item` into the list
directly **after** the `after` item, or if `after` is not found then at the
**end** of the list.

```java
/**
 * Insert an item into the list, after another item.
 * 
 * @param item  the item to insert
 * @param after the item to insert after; if not found then the item will become
 *              the new end of the list
 */
public void insertAfter(T item, T after) {
    // TODO insert item behind after, or the end of the list if not found
}
```

### Task 5: insert before an existing item

Implement `insertBefore(item, before)`, which should insert `item` into the list
directly **before** the `before` item, or if `before` is not found then at the
**start** of the list.

```java
/**
 * Insert an item into the list, before another item.
 * 
 * @param item   the item to insert
 * @param before the item to insert before; if not found then the item will
 *               become the new start of the list
 */
public void insertBefore(T item, T before) {
    // TODO insert item in front of before, or the start of the list if not found
}
```

### Task 6: remove item from list

Implement `remove(item)`, which should remove `item` from the list and return `true` if the item was
found, or `false` otherwise. 

```java
/**
 * Remove an item from the list.
 * 
 * @param item the item to remove
 * @return {@code true} if the item was found in the list and removed,
 *         {@code false} otherwise
 */
public boolean remove(T item) {
    boolean removed = false;

    // TODO: find and remove the given item from the list

    return removed;
}
```

### Task 7: reverse the list

Implement the `reverse()` method, which should flip the list so that the last item becomes
the first, and the order of all items is reversed.

```java
/**
 * Reverse the list.
 */
public void reverse() {
    // TODO: reverse the list
}
```
